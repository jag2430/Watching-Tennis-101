                A player must hit a shot either before the
                ball has bounced or after the first
                bounce. If the ball bounces twice, then
                the player with the last shot wins the
                point. <br>
                <br>
                A player must also wait for the ball to
                pass the net and come over to their side
                of the court. The player cannot step over
                the net to hit the ball. The player also cannot touch the net when the point is live.
